          This design is made of grids of ellipses whose sizes react to the
          position of the mouse.
          <br />
          The colors are randomly generated.
          <br />
          I chose a greenish palette because it's autumn and I like it.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the next iteration, I hope to make it audio reactive, such that the
          ellipses' sizes react to the audio input
          <em>(probably from a microphone)</em>
